            "Non-RelationaI Databases (noSQL / not just SQL)"

#Non-Relational Database Management Systems (NRDBMS):
--> Help users create and maintain a non-relational database
--> mongoDB, dynamoDB, apache cassandra, firebase, etc

#Implementation Specific
--> Any non-relational database falls under this category, so there's no set
    language standard.
--> Most NRDBMS will implement their own language for performing
    C.R.U.D and administrative operations on the database.
